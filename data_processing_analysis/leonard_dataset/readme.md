TLDR: 1,300 swallows (partly annotated) of healthy patients

Pros:
- swallows were already extracted
- already partly annotated


Cons / Challenges:
- [ ] no patient information -> only young and eldery folder
- [ ] videos contain metadata (time, ...)

### Folder structure:
- ForeBack folder
   - mp4 files and some have .mask files as well
  - 800 files
- Normals folder
    - mp4 files and some have .mask files as well
    - 70 files
    - readme file:
        -  Here's a link to the young normal fluoros.  Typically include a 1ml, 3ml 3-5 paste and 20+ml bolus.......some have another 1ml.  Subjects are also saying vowel sounds at the end......think it's obvious these aren't swallows! Hope they're helpful....let me know if you have questions.
